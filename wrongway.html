            <h1>Mechanical Wrong-Way Driving Prevention System</h1>
            <p>The Mechanical Wrong-Way Driving Prevention System is a robust solution designed to mitigate the lethal risks of wrong-way driving on highways, developed during my Mechanical Engineering capstone at Arizona State University in 2024. As part of a seven-member team, I collaborated on the design and prototyping of a speed hump system, taking sole responsibility for its electrical components to alert impaired drivers through tactile and electronic feedback, enhancing road safety without disrupting normal traffic.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong><br>
            Wrong-way driving, though only 1% of highway accidents, has a 25% fatality rate, claiming 300-400 lives annually in Arizona, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Predominantly caused by impaired drivers (65% of cases) at night, these incidents demand more effective deterrents than traditional signs. Our challenge was to create a cost-effective, durable system to alert drivers while preserving vehicle and road integrity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Approach</strong><br>
            Our team explored passive traffic calming measures before settling on a pointed, hinged speed hump design to maximize driver awareness. We collectively utilized SolidWorks for CAD modeling and ANSYS for finite element analysis (FEA) to ensure structural reliability, transitioning from a plywood proof-of-concept to a steel prototype. I spearheaded the integration of an active electronic system, using an Arduino-based circuit to detect driving direction, all within a $700 budget.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Design and Prototyping</strong><br>
            The system features steel plates forming depressible ramps, connected by integrated hinges and shoulder bolts, a design refined through team-wide CAD efforts in SolidWorks. The initial plywood prototype evolved into a steel version for enhanced durability, costing $401.85. I independently designed and implemented the electrical system, employing aluminum foil contact switches beneath the plates, connected to an Arduino Uno R3, to signal direction via LED alerts. Team-conducted FEA confirmed safety factors of 2.5-3.3 under 1000 lbf loads, validated by low-speed tests.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Feasibility and Safety</strong><br>
            Engineered for heavy use and weathering, the steel structure withstands stress with springs and rollers, while my electrical system enhances detection without additional infrastructure. The passive humps provide tactile feedback, and the active electronics—my contribution—ensure visibility, all installable with minimal road changes. Tests confirmed functionality without vehicle damage, with future fatigue analysis planned for higher speeds.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results and Impact</strong><br>
            Live demonstrations proved the system’s efficacy: the mechanical humps jolted drivers, and my electrical circuit accurately triggered LED signals for wrong-way detection. With safety factors above 2.5 and 57.4% budget utilization, this project offers a scalable, affordable safety solution, blending team-driven mechanical design with my electrical innovation, poised to reduce highway fatalities.</p>
