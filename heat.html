            <h1>Heat Resilience Challenge</h1>
            <p>Initially developed during my participation in Arizona State University’s EPICS program, this project evolved, after I was finished with the project, into a novel ventilation system inspired by PC tower cooling, designed to deliver efficient, affordable relief in extreme heat. Targeting mobile home parks, it addresses the severe heat-related risks faced by residents through innovative airflow solutions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong><br>
            Mobile home residents in Arizona face a disproportionate risk of heat-related illness and death due to poor insulation, limited cooling access, and socioeconomic constraints. With extreme summer temperatures exacerbating these vulnerabilities, this project aimed to identify and innovate practical solutions for heat mitigation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Approach</strong><br>
            As part of the EPICS team, we conducted market research on commercial solutions—portable ACs, misters, sunshades, and solar panels—using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and engineering analysis to evaluate cost, efficiency, and feasibility. After leaving the team, I expanded this foundation, conceptualizing a complete overhaul of a mobile home unit with a PC-inspired ventilation system to optimize airflow and reduce internal temperatures.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Design and Simulation</strong><br>
            Using SolidWorks, I designed a mobile home unit as a virtual air-cooled tower, integrating inexpensive PC fans in an optimal layout—intake at the base to draw in cooler air and exhaust near the roof to expel heat. ANSYS simulations modeled airflow dynamics, with colored smoke visualization confirming a continuous cooling loop within the digital prototype.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Feasibility and Safety</strong><br>
            This low-cost design prioritizes accessibility, leveraging affordable materials and simple assembly. The virtual unit seals when fans are off, with simulated protective flaps inspired by PC dust filters, safeguarding against dust, weather, and water ingress. The system’s minimal power draw aligns with mobile home energy constraints, ensuring practicality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results and Impact</strong><br>
            Simulations in ANSYS demonstrated a streamlined airflow path, predicting significant temperature reductions within the modeled unit. This conceptual design showcases a scalable, community-driven solution, highlighting how engineering innovation can address real-world challenges and improve living conditions for mobile home residents.</p>
