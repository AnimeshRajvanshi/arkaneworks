                <h2>Wrong-Way Interceptor</h2>
                <p>As part of my MEE capstone at Arizona State University (January–December 2024), I contributed to designing, machining, and assembling a mechanical system to prevent wrong-way driving. Using SolidWorks, I modeled an active speed hump made of rows of depressible stainless steel ramps, then ran ANSYS simulations to validate its durability and functionality. I built an Arduino Uno R3 circuit to detect driving direction by analyzing the order of ramp depressions, ensuring the system adapts dynamically to traffic. This project showcases my skills in CAD, simulation, and prototyping for a real-world safety solution.</p>

                <h2>Ocean Sentinel CubeSat</h2>
                <p>From July 2021 to July 2022, I managed the Hyperspectral CubeSat project at ASU’s Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory, leading a team of engineering students to design a CubeSat with a hyperspectral camera aimed at cataloging ocean plastic pollution. I established the scientific mission, delegated tasks like camera integration and structural design, and revamped our sponsorship package to secure funding. I also supported the lab’s board by managing the workshop, planning outreach events, and ensuring resource allocation, delivering a small satellite with a bold environmental vision.</p>

                <h2>Cool Haven Prototype</h2>
                <p>During the EPICS Heat Resilience Challenge (August 2020–May 2021) at ASU, I collaborated with a community partner at Westwood mobile home park to combat excessive heat. As sub-team lead, I analyzed cooling options like reflective coatings and ventilation systems, then designed and prototyped a small-scale mobile home unit with an optimized airflow system using CAD tools. This hands-on project blended engineering innovation with community impact, creating a practical, scalable solution to enhance heat resilience in vulnerable living spaces.</p>

                <h2>Nano-Probe Vanguard</h2>
                <p>Since May 2024, I’ve researched nanoelectronics metrology and failure analysis at ASU’s Celano Lab, focusing on chiplets from top industry vendors. I implement scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) to detect flaws and use CIVA NDT software to simulate these analyses, ensuring precision in defect identification. I’ve created detailed CAD models for SAM simulations and 3D assets for research papers, while conducting literature reviews on Cu-Cu hybrid bonding and failure modes in advanced 3D packaging. This work advances semiconductor reliability for cutting-edge tech.</p>

                <h2>Lunar Power Grid</h2>
                <p>For NASA’s Watts on the Moon Challenge, my team and I developed a power delivery solution for lunar operations, adapting a JAXA-Toyota Lunar Cruiser rover to lay cables across the lunar surface. I helped design a proprietary cable-laying mechanism, inspired by electric dog collar trenchers, to connect power plants to modified lunar landers serving as battery packs. We incorporated space-grade docking connectors to prevent contamination and added corrosion-resistant coatings to the rover and cables to withstand abrasive lunar sand, ensuring reliable energy distribution for Artemis missions.</p>
